# hafiz-memory
Hafiz Memory is your personal mind-space — a simple, powerful place to save every thought, screenshot, reel, and idea the moment it appears. Instead of letting important things get lost across apps, chats, and social media, Hafiz Memory brings everything together and organizes it neatly by topic or category.

The service worker needs to cache files first
